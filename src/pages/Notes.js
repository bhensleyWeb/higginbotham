                <h1>Credit</h1>
                <p>Credit should be given where credit is due. I could not have surmassed all this information without the help of several individuals willing to assist a novice such as myself. Full appriciation and ample credit is extended to the following individuals. Some are novice geneologists such as myself and others more avid researchers. All were instrimental in helping me piece together this family tree.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lavina Grace Schwarz - Cresap Society - Thank you Lavinia for your assitance and help with the Cresap family and all the work you do for the society. Also thank you for personally looking into my tree in your spare time to help me find those hard to locate clues.</li>
                    <li>William Higginbotham (a.k.a. Mr. Higg) for his encouragment and inspiration to generate my own site.</li>
                    <li>@millers1956 - Ms. Millers for her work with the Hankins - Keogh lines </li>
                    <li>Glenn O'Meara - Glenn, avid geneologist, helped me authenticate the Hankins - Cresap line and has access to the Hankins family bible that provides the link between the Cresaps and the Higginbotham lines 100 years after Cresap's War.</li>
                    <li>Sheryl Vito - Sheryl, a fellow decendant from Ralph Higginbotham and the source of the "We're native American" myth William (Indian Billy) Ice.</li>
                    <li>The countless other geneologists on all the geneology sites for sharing their findings.

            <div><h1>Conclusions</h1>
            <p><b>The Henthorns</b> - The Henthorn family is more than just a random occurance in our tree. They were more than aquantences in the late 1600s and early 1700s. Documents seem to show these families were close. Wherever you see a Higginbotham, there was a Henthorn. Both families took part in Cresap's war and granted land in PA during/after the conflict. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Ralph (or John Ralph) Higginbotham</b> - The origin of Higginbothams is not an easy one. In the full tree with all known relatives there is a Ralph, a Ralph Henry, and a John Ralph Higginbotham all living at the same time. Additionally there are three Samuels, several Uriahs, Two Nathan Hankins (uncle/nephew),  a plethera of women named Mary, Elizabeth, or Margaret. This is due to the common practice of naming children after beloved relatives (Fathers, Grandfathers, Mothers, Aunts, Uncles...etc.) Becuase of this confusion and lack of record keeping, it is difficult to determine whose who in many accounts. Like many geneologists, I attempted to do the best I could by using context while focusing on those individuals.</p>
            <p>Because of the duplicate names and close dates of events, there are some who belive that our John Ralph Higginbotham is the same J.R. Higginbotham that settled in Barbados. I do not believe this to be true. Many Higginbotham geneologists continue to quibble over who is who.</p>
            <p>Ralph Higginbotham was reportedly raised by his Uncle Capt. Charles Higginbotham - who raised two of his brother's children (unknown which brother). A boy and a girl. Some have proposed that his father may have been Thomas, but with no evidence, I cannot make that link. It could have easily been Richard, or more likely John Ralph given birth dates and locations.</p></div>
            <div><h1>Duplicates</h1>
            <p>When viewing the family tree, you may see duplicates. This is because I have yet to find any geneology software that can correctly or aptly display certain situations such as step-parents, adopted parents, or kissing cousins. One example is Ralph Higginbotham (1723-1780) who married Mary Henthorn. Mary Henthorn was daughter to John Henthorn and Mary Higginbotham - Sister to John-Ralph Higginbotham. Since Mary Higginbotham and J.R. Higginbotham have the same parents, they are displayed twice. Never make fun of kissing cousins - you may have some in your tree. </p></div>
            <div><h1>There can be only one.</h1>
            <p>But, my family name only has 1 g in Higinbotham. When did that start? The answer to this question is far more simplistic than it may seem. Samual Hudson Higinbotham (1789 - 1861) simply did not like the double 'g' and spelled his name with one 'g' unlike all his siblings. </p></div>
