                <h1>Credit</h1>
                <p>Credit should be given where credit is due. I could not have surmassed all this information without the help of several individuals willing to assist a novice such as myself. Full appriciation and ample credit is extended to the following individuals. Some are novice geneologists such as myself and others more avid researchers. All were instrimental in helping me piece together this family tree.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lavina Grace Schwarz - Cresap Society - Thank you Lavinia for your assitance and help with the Cresap family and all the work you do for the society. Also thank you for personally looking into my tree in your spare time to help me find those hard to locate clues.</li>
                    <li>William HIgginbotham (a.k.a. Mr. Higg) for his encouragment and inspiration to generate my own site.</li>
                    <li>@millers1956 - Ms. Millers for her work with the Hankins - Keogh lines </li>
                    <li>Glenn O'Meara - Glenn helped me authenticate the Hankins - Cresap line and has the Hankins family bible that provides the link between the Cresaps and the Higginbotham lines 100 years after Cresap's War.</li>
                    <li>Sheryl Vito - Sheryl, a fellow decendant from Ralph Higginbotham and the source of the "We're native American" myth William (Indian Billy) Ice.</li>
                    <li>The countless other geneologists on all the geneology sites for sharing their findings.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div><h1>Conclusions</h1></div>
            <div><h1>Duplicates</h1>
            <p>When viewing the family tree, you may see duplicates. This is because I have yet to find any geneology software that can correctly or aptly display certain situations such as step-parents, adopted parents, or kissing cousins. One example is Ralph Higginbotham (1723-1780) who married Mary Henthorn. Mary Henthorn was daughter to John Henthorn and Mary Higginbotham - Sister to John-Ralph Higginbotham. Since Mary Higginbotham and J.R. Higginbotham have the same parents, they are displayed twice. Never make fun of kissing cousins - you may have some in your tree. </p></div>
