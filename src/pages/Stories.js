        <div><h2>William (Indian Billy) Ice</h2>
        <p><img src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/images/william-galloway-ice.jpg`} style={{ float: 'left', padding: '0 10px 0 0' }} alt="Indian Billy" /> There has long been 'legend' that we are part native american - stories of an ancestor kidnapped by indians who had returned back to the 'white man'. My own personal dna test shows no sign of this, however I believe this rumor started with the story of William 'Indian Billy Ice'.</p>
        <p>"Indian Billy was a kind and gentle man, often, but he had “mischievous Indian ways”, like growing a large pumpkin field and helping the neighbor children steal his own pumpkins."</p>
        <p> William Galloway Ice was ten years old when he was kidnapped by Mohawk Indians in West Virginia. He would later be sold to the Shawnee Indians before he escaped. After living with the Indians for several years he returned back to civilization. Once back with his own people, William led the life most men at the time did. He served in the Revolutionary War in the Virginia Militia. He would marry many women (Two of which were reportedly Higginbotham women - daughters of Ralph Higginbotham). William would commission over 500 acres in what is now West Virginia which became the subject of dispute in multiple courts related to inheiritence and estate ownership among all those claiming to be children of 'Indian' Billy. While not a direct ancester of me or mine, William Ice is still an interesting character in our family's history.</p>
        <p>Due to poor record keeping, and perhaps the "legend" aspect of it all, it is unclear as to how many wives or children Indian Billy had. He may have had anywhere from 3 - 7 wives and upwards of 20+ children, making William Ice the father of most of the Ice lineage.</p>

        <h2>I was sucked into a jet engine.</h2>
        <p>On May 14, 1956, Airman Third Class Fred Higinbotham was working as a flight deck crewman in Okinawa, Japan. His job was to attach a 'static line' to a jet's nose gear while they were refueling to prevent sparks from ignighting the fuel.  A flight of F-86F Sabre jets was coming in for refueling. Fred was attaching his static line when he was 'sucked' into the air intake duct on the plane. He began to hover in the air only inches from the spinning rotor blades. Thankfully, Grandpa Fred made it and we are all here because of it. </p>
        <p>Grandpa Fred's full account of the harrowing experience can be found in multiple newspapers and even in congressional records after his return back to the States. To read his account of the experience, click <a href={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/docs/The_Knoxville_Journal_Sun__Feb_3__1957_.jpg`} target="blank">here</a>.

        <h2>Cresap's War ,the role Higginbothams Played, and happy endings.</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Background</b><br />
          Pennsylvania's Charter (1681) specified that the colony was bounded "on the South by a Circle drawne at twelve miles [19 km] distance from New Castle Northward and Westward unto the beginning of the fortieth degree of Northern Latitude, and then by a streight Line Westward...." Later surveys established that the town of New Castle in fact lay a full 25 miles (40 km) south of the fortieth parallel, setting the stage for the boundary dispute. Maryland insisted that the boundary be drawn at the fortieth parallel as specified in the Charter, while Pennsylvania proposed that it be drawn by an elaborate method which purported to compensate for the geographic misunderstanding on which the Charter had been based. This proposal placed the boundary near 39 36', creating a 28-mile (45 km) wide strip of disputed territory between the two colonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          After years of confused settlers and multiple claims to territory, vilence began to break out in the 1730's. Colonel Thomas Cresap had established a ferry service along the river with permission of Lord Calvert, Lord of Baltimore. At the same time, Capt. Charles Higginbotham had established a trading station near Cresaps ferry. Col. Cresap and several men were commisioned by Lord Baltimore to run out Dutch Settlers from Yourk and Lancaster counties in what was believed to be Maryland territory. Among those men was a Capt Charles Higginbotham and his nephew Ralph Higginbotham(from wich we decened). At one point, Col. Cresap was captured and later freed by Capt. Higginbotham.
        </p>
        <p>Long story short - nobody won. After years of fighing, it was decided that neither side had claim to the land and a temporary border was established. In 1767, descendants of the Penns and Calverts hired surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon to establish a boundary (The Mason-Dixon Line).  </p>
        <p>Many of the Higginbotham families that took part in dispute settled on the land promised by Lord Calvert in what is now Lancaster county, PA. Capt. Charles Higginbotham layed claim to a strech of land known today as Charles Mount. </p>
        <p>Wait, where's the happy ending you ask. On 7 Sep. 1957, Fred Edward Higginbotham married a young lady named Leona Margaret Leonard. Leona is the great-granddaughter of one Mary Cresap (3xGreat - granddaughter of Col Cresap). This marriage would join the Cresaps and the Higginbothams ~200 Years after Cresap's War. It is worth noting that Capt. Charles Higginbotham was considered by many at the time to be Cresap's <em>right-hand man</em>. Surprisingly, these families did not join sooner. The marriage between Mary Cresap to Nathan Hankins in 1846 was hard to track down. The only known record is a mention in the Hankins family Bible, which no-one seemed to have. Thankfully, Glenn O'Meara was able to help me authenticate the marriage on more then hearsay by confirming his family was in possesion of the Hankins Bible. Even though it has been some time since her passing, I would like to think that Grandma Higinbotham would like to know she was a Daughter of the American Revolution. </p>
        <p>A simple 'Google' search for Cresaps War will reveal a plethera of information on the border dispute. </p>

        <h2>Other Notables</h2>
          <p>Other notable Higginbothams include one George Washington Higginbotham. G.W. Higginbotham was sone of Ralph Higginbotham, nephew of Charles Higginbotham who raised him. It is unclear who the parents of Ralph Higginbotham are. It is most likely John Ralph Higginbotham or Thomas Higginbotham (both brothers of Charles). George W. Higginbotham was an active member of the Maryland charter and penned the proposal of a new county in Maryland - "Prince George County". This proposal was also signed by Van Swearingen (Cresap). </p>
          <p>Whenever you come across the surname Higginbotham in early american history, you will most assuridly see a Henthorn close by. The Henthorn's and Higginbotham's were close families that shared more than the ocassional dinner table. I have found numerous documents listing John and James Henthorn with Ralph and Charles HIgginbotham. In fact, One Henthorn brother would marry Mary Margaret Higginbotham. And their daughter Mary later marrie Ralph Henry Higginbotham. *shhh - kissing cousins, I know.</p>
